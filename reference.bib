   abstract = {Link puzzles involve finding paths or a cycle in a grid that satisfy given local and global properties. This paper proposes algorithms that enumerate solutions and instances of two link puzzles, Slitherlink and Numberlink, by zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams (ZDDs). A ZDD is a compact data structure for a family of sets provided with a rich family of set operations, by which, for example, one can easily extract a subfamily satisfying a desired property. Thanks to the nature of ZDDs, our algorithms offer a tool to assist users to design instances of those link puzzles. © 2012 by the authors.},

   abstract = {Procedural content generation (PCG) for games has existed since the 1980s and is becoming increasingly important for creating game worlds, backstory, and characters across many genres, in particular, open-world games, such as Minecraft (2011) and No Man's Sky (2016). A particular challenge faced by such games is that the content and/or gameplay may become repetitive. Puzzles constitute an effective technique for improving gameplay by offering players interesting problems to solve, but the use of PCG for generating puzzles has been limited compared with its use for other game elements, and efforts have focused mainly on games that are strictly puzzle games, rather than creating puzzles to be incorporated into other genres. Nevertheless, a significant body of work exists, which allows puzzles of different types to be generated algorithmically, and there is scope for much more research into this area. This paper presents a detailed survey of existing work in PCG for puzzles, reviewing 32 methods within 11 categories of puzzles. For the purpose of analysis, this paper identifies a total of seven salient characteristics related to the methods, which are used to show commonalities and differences between techniques and to chart promising areas for future research.},

   abstract = {As networks become ubiquitous in people's lives, users depend on networks a lot for sufficient communication and convenient information access. However, networks suffer from security issues. Network security becomes a challenging topic since numerous new network attacks have appeared increasingly sophisticated and caused vast loss to network resources. Game theoretic approaches have been introduced as a useful tool to handle those tricky network attacks. In this paper, we review the existing game-theory based solutions for network security problems, classifying their application scenarios under two categories, attack-defense analysis and security measurement. Moreover, we present a brief view of the game models in those solutions and summarize them into two categories, cooperative game models and non-cooperative game models with the latter category consisting of subcategories. In addition to the introduction to the state of the art, we discuss the limitations of those game theoretic approaches and propose future research directions. © 1998-2012 IEEE.},
